In this research, R code is used to visualize the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases because of its ability to handle datasets efficiently. A histogram chart is employed along with a normal distribution curve to illustrate the data's distribution and also helps in identify underlying patterns and factors influencing the data. The resulting plot is shown below.
 
1.3.2	Inference from the Visual Plot
From the above visual plot, it is inferred that the plot reveals the overall distribution pattern of confirmed cases across the dataset, offering a broader context to interpret the averages. Further, it reveals that the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases does not follow a normal distribution, thus the statistical test chosen is Mann-Whitney U test. Plot margins are set, and the final output is saved as a PDF file named "visualization.pdf".
1.3.3	Understanding the data
The box plot shows the mean of confirmed cases for each category and it shows the difference between the mean of confirmed Covid cases for Groups and Non-Groups. 
 
From the above box plot, the "Group" bar is higher than the "Non-Group" bar, which indicates that the group has a higher mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
